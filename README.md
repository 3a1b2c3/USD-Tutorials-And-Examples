# USD Tutorials and Examples

## About
This project showcases educational material for [Pixar's Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html) (USD).

For convenience, the Jupyter notebook from the GTC session is available on Google Colaboratory, which offers an interactive environment from the comfort of your web browser.  Colaboratory makes it possible to:
 * Try code snippets without building or installing USD on your machine
 * Run the samples on any device
 * Share code experiments with others

Should you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine instead, simply download and execute it after [installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

## Sample Notebook
